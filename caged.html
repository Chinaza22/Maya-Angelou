    <p><strong>Caged Bird</strong> <br> By <u><strong>Maya Angelou</strong> </u></p>
    <p>
        A free bird leaps<br>
        on the back of the wind   <br>
        and floats downstream  <br> 
        till the current ends <br>
        and dips his wing <br>
        in the orange sun rays<br>
        and dares to claim the sky.
    </p> <br> <br>
    
    <p>
        But a bird that stalks<br>
        down his narrow cage<br>
        can seldom see through<br>
        his bars of rage<br>
        his wings are clipped and<br>   
        his feet are tied<br>
        so he opens his throat to sing.<br> <br>
    </p>    

    <p>
        The caged bird sings   <br>
        with a fearful trill   <br>
        of things unknown   <br>
        but longed for still   <br>
        and his tune is heard   <br>
        on the distant hill   <br>
        for the caged bird   <br>
        sings of freedom.<br> <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        The free bird thinks of another breeze<br>
        and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees<br>
        and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn<br>
        and he names the sky his own<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>
        But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams <br>  
        his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream   <br>
        his wings are clipped and his feet are tied   <br>
        so he opens his throat to sing. <br><br>
    </p>

    <p>
        The caged bird sings <br>  
        with a fearful trill   <br>
        of things unknown   <br>
        but longed for still   <br>
        and his tune is heard   <br>
        on the distant hill   <br>
        for the caged bird   <br>
        sings of freedom. <br>
