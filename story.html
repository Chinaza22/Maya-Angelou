    <h1 id="Ela">Why Maya Angelou stopped talking</h1>
    <p><strong>Maya Angelou,</strong> who died May 28, in her office in Winston-Salem, N.C., Sept. 16, 1996.

        (Chuck Burton)
        
        When she was 8 years old, Maya Angelou stopped speaking. She silenced her voice because she thought her voice had killed a man. For almost five years, she spoke to no one but her beloved brother, Bailey.
        
        The man she believed she had killed with her voice -- her mother's boyfriend, Mr. Freeman -- had raped her. After she testified against him in his trial, he was convicted and sentenced, but released from jail. Four days later, he was found dead. Murdered. Probably by Angelou's uncles, her memoir implies.</p>

    <p class="Fine">Angelou, who died Wednesday, told this story in her first book, "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings," her groundbreaking memoir about her childhood in the Jim Crow South. Published in 1969, when she was 41 years old, the book established her voice – the one she had silenced as a child -- as one of the most important in American literature. She went on to write six more memoirs, poetry, plays, screenplays, short stories, articles, music and two cookbooks, but "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" remains the work for which she is best known.</p>

   <p class="Fine"> Her work and her life offer readers a personal journey through the African American experience of the 20th century, an experience that included friendships with Malcolm X, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and James Baldwin. She wrote with blazing honesty about racism, rape, her pregnancy at 16 and the deep fractures in her own family. Her strong voice spoke to countless readers, particularly black readers, who in 1969 were starved for literature by black authors writing intimately and truthfully about growing up and living in the "other" America.</p>
        
   <p>But in "Caged Bird," Angelou's voice especially spoke to young women – young black women, but also young white women, who, even if they had not been raped or assaulted, always lived with the knowledge and fear of that trauma.</p>

   <p>Many of us read "Caged Bird" in high school, an age when its themes of finding identity, strength and courage carry deep resonance. Angelou spoke to me, a middle-class white girl from the suburbs, in a voice that, once she started using it again, had a power that will live on long after her death.</p>
